# Synchronous-FIFO-Verification
This repository contains the SystemVerilog-based verification of a Synchronous FIFO. It includes constrained randomization, functional coverage, and a reference model for checking outputs. Assertions ensure proper behavior of flags and counters, focusing on thorough validation of the FIFO functionality.
